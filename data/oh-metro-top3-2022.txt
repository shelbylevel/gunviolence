Caveats:
"1. These items in the results table are not fully selected: Other external causes of accidental injury, Intentional self-harm,"
"Assault. The Query Description lists the actual values selected."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Unreliable."
"3. The population figures for years 2021 and later are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, based on the"
"Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count, from the Vintage 2021"
"postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 30, 2022. The population figures for year 2020 are single-race estimates"
"of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2020 postcensal series based on April 2010 Census, released by the Census"
"Bureau on July 27, 2021. The population figures for year 2019 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from"
"the Vintage 2019 postcensal series based on April 2010 Census, released by the Census Bureau on June 25, 2020. The population"

"4. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Age"
"Group."
"5. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Deaths with the underlying cause classified with O00-O99 are"
"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
"processing and review and therefore should not be considered final for statistical purposes. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"6. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"
"2020."
"7. Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#ICD-10 Changes."
"8. Deaths related to external causes of injury or sudden death: In the provisional mortality data, causes of death classified as"
"external causes of injury (ICD-10 codes V01-Y89) or sudden deaths (ICD-10 codes R95 and R96) have the cause of death labeled as"
"'Data not shown due to 6 month lag to account for delays in death certificate completion for certain causes of death.' For these"
